      Easing functions available for use in the application. All easing equations are functions returning a value between start<startValue> and end values (<startValue> + <changeInValue>) at the current iteration<currentIteration> proportional to the total iterations<totalIterations>. The value is calculated along the curve represented by the easing equation on value/time axis. Visual examples of easing curves can be seen here: [Easing Equations](https://easings.net/)
